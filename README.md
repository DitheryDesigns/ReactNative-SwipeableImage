# ReactNative-SwipeableImage

Welcome to the ReactNative-SwipeableImage project! This React Native component provides swipeable image functionality, mimicking a Tinder-like image swiping experience. It's perfect for applications where image browsing should be intuitive and engaging.

## Features

- Easy to integrate with any React Native project.
- Smooth and responsive swipe animations.
- Customizable swipe responses and thresholds.

## Installation

Follow these steps to integrate the swipeable image component into your React Native application:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
# If using Expo
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

# Wrap your app component
Wrap your root component with <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use the SwipeableImage component in your application:

```javascript
import SwipeableImage from 'path-to-component/SwipeableImage';

function App() {
  return (
    <SwipeableImage
      images={imageDataArray}
      onSwipeOff={(direction, index) => console.log(`Swiped ${direction} on image at index ${index}`)}
    />
  );
}
```

Replace `path-to-component` with the actual path where the `SwipeableImage` component is located, and `imageDataArray` with your array of images.
